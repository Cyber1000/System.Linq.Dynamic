This is the Microsoft assembly for the .Net 4.0 Dynamic language functionality.

I am in no way taking ownership of this assembly!  I'm am simply making it available since it seems very hard to find.  I've also created a NuGet package so it's easy to import into your Visual Studio projects.  You can install it via NuGet with this command in the Nuget Package Manager:

install-package System.Linq.Dynamic

I've just forked from King Wilder, I needed a strong signed assembly. The assembly is not changed in any other way. Nuget package is updated here for download. Disclaimer from King Wilder applies here too.
